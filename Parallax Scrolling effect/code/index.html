            <h2>Mountains are  Awesome</h2>
            <p>Mountains are important because they influence regional and global weather 
                conditions and climate. They provide human beings with medicinal products, 
                food, biodiversity, energy and freshwater. Mountains provide home for 720 
                million people, according to the United Nations Development Programme.<br />
                <br/>
                Billions of people living in lowlands benefit from mountains. They are the sources
                of both major and small rivers on Earth. Mountains also play an important role in
                the water cycle because they capture moisture from the atmosphere and release it in
                the form of snow or water, which is essential for industries, settlements and agricultural 
                activities downstream. Water from mountains is also used to generate hydroelectric power.
                Renewable energy from mountains promotes economic development, especially in rural areas.
                In developing countries, wood fuel from mountains is the main source of energy for settlements.
                Mountain wood provides timber for local use and export. Mountains are centers of biodiversity, 
                because they have plant, crop and animal diversity. They are also the sources of wild foods, 
                such as mushrooms, birds and game. Mountains also provide ground for recreation, sporting and 
                tourism activities.However, mountains are prone to land degradation, climate change, natural 
                disasters and deforestation. Their populations often suffer from poverty, marginalization
                and lack of access to education and health services.<br />
                <br/>
                Mountains are important to us because they're a huge factor in our ecosystem They provide 
                diverse fauna and flora, recreational activities amazing features etc. It also helps people 
                who live on lowland as it blocks wild weather. Mountains also contain minerals, water, wood and timber,.In Mountains, 
                we can get mineral deposits, it has significant influence on climate and determine the course of
                economic Mountain barriers with their relatively narrow passes have made various ranges throughout 
                the world.Mountains are landforms that rise prominently above the surrounding landscape. They are
                topographic features that are defined by a high relief, and their most general features are that they
                encompass a certain elevational range, have steep slopes, and converge toward small summit areas
